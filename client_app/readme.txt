To automatically refresh the OAuth2 token and handle its expiration seamlessly for multiple requests, we need to implement a token refresh mechanism in the library. This way, whenever the access token expires, the system will automatically use the refresh token to obtain a new access token and continue making requests without requiring manual intervention.

Steps to Implement Token Refresh:
Obtain Refresh Token: When the initial access token is obtained, Azure AD will return both an access token and a refresh token.
Store Access Token and Refresh Token: Store the access token and refresh token securely for later use.
Automatic Token Refresh: Before making a request, check if the access token has expired. If it has, use the refresh token to request a new access token.
Re-use the New Token: After refreshing, continue with the same request or any subsequent requests without needing the user to re-authenticate.


Explanation of Changes:
Access Token and Refresh Token Handling:

The accessToken and refreshToken are stored in memory along with the tokenExpirationTime (the time at which the access token expires).
When the exchangeAuthorizationCodeForToken method is called, it retrieves both the access token and the refresh token and calculates when the token will expire.
Token Expiration Check:

The getAccessToken method is introduced, which checks if the current access token has expired. If expired, it calls the refreshAccessToken method to get a new one.
If the token is still valid, it simply returns the existing access token.
Token Refresh:

The refreshAccessToken method sends a request to the token endpoint with the stored refresh token to obtain a new access token (and refresh token if necessary).
It updates the access token, refresh token, and token expiration time whenever a new token is obtained.

Key Points to Consider:
Security: Be mindful of securely storing the refresh token and access token (especially in production). You may want to use a more secure method of storage (like a database or a vault) rather than keeping them in memory.
Refresh Token Expiry: Azureâ€™s refresh tokens also have an expiry, though it's usually much longer than the access token. Make sure to handle cases where the refresh token might expire by prompting the user to re-authenticate.
Concurrent Requests: If your application is making multiple requests at the same time, make sure to handle token refreshing in a thread-safe manner (especially in multi-threaded applications).
