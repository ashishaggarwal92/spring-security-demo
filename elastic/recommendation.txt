1) Restrict only HTTP access (9200) to localhost, but allow clustering (9300)
2) Prevents external clients from accessing :9200
3) Allows nodes to talk to each other on :9300
4) Keeps REST API available only locally
5) Missing discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes — dangerous in 2-node setups. This is critical in a 2-node cluster to prevent split-brain.If you don't set this, both nodes may think they're the master, causing data loss or cluster instability
6) Missing node.master / node.data — not required but strongly recommended.
7) network.host uses hostname + _local_, which can work if hostname resolution is solid and correct in /etc/hosts or DNS.


Check Confirm that 9200 is only bound to 127.0.0.1:
if it is giving more than one entry then we need to bound it using hostname
-- netstat -tulnp | grep 9200
